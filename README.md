How did the project's design evolve over time?
 After starting with Raw SQL I ended up switches to ORM in order to follow Week 3
 
Did you choose to use an ORM or raw SQL? Why?
  Choose ORM but still struggle to following all the different files and how they are linked. 
  
What future improvements are in store, if any? 

None I can think of at this time. Need a deeper dive first into all that was done in the twitter example. 


Project is not complete but I did learn some things :)
